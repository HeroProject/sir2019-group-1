## IND Intake Robot
Aiding the Dutch Immigration Service in conducting interviews with asylum seekers.

In 2018, over twenty thousand refugees crossed the Dutch borders. Upon arrival, everyone has to apply for asylum at an application center in the Netherlands to officially become a refugee. The big influx of asylum seekers has led to big waiting lists at the application centers, and as many asylum seekers can’t speak another language than their own, there’s a lot of trouble with the intake interview by the IND. Within this research, the NAO robot is proposed to conduct the first intake interview instead of a human employee.
